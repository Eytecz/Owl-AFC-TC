# Owl AFC-TC Expansion Board

![Owl AFC-TC Board Render](./images/Owl_AFC-TC_top.png)

The **Owl AFC-TC** is an open-source expansion board for advanced multi-toolhead 3D printers running Klipper firmware. It is designed to support high-performance, modular printing systems with automatic filament changers and CAN-connected toolheads.

This board was inspired by the [AFC-Lite project by xbst](https://github.com/xbst/AFC-Lite) and builds upon its foundation with a broader feature set, more I/O, and support for complex toolchanger configurations. It is also compatible with the [AFC Klipper Add-On](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/AFC-Klipper-Add-On), allowing seamless integration into Klipper-controlled systems.

The Owl AFC-TC board is built to control up to **4 toolheads** and **4 independent filament changers**, each capable of handling **2 spools**, for a total of 8 spools in a fully automated, multi-material 3D printer.

## Use Case

This board is designed for advanced 3D printing setups involving:
- Multi-toolhead configurations
- Automatic filament changers (boxturtle-style or custom)
- CAN-based modular communication
- Centralized I/O for distributed printer components

Its modular design enables high scalability and flexibility while minimizing wiring complexity in your printer.
